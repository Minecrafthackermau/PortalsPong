# Portals Pong
A classic pong game with a portal twist (HTML5/Canvas/JS) 

Instructions: use the up and down arrow keys to move the right paddle.
*Note: You will probably need to click on the document so that it can get focus and start receiving key events.

TODO: 
  - (add) sound effects, music, particle effects, smash ability, elastic collision
  - (fix) ai that never loses, speed up ball over time, portal loop should speed up ball
  - (bug) keyboard control is not responsive, portal random teleports is expensive
